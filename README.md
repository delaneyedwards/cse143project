If you are using our program in an IDE, you will have to download all of the files from Github. To do this, follow our link to the github repo and click the green download code button on the right. Select Download ZIP. Once downloaded, you will want to unzip the file and open game.py in the IDE of your choice (that can handle Python). We recommend Visual Studio Code. Click inside the code file and then run it. You should see a small game window pop up, and you are ready to go!

If you don't need to look at our code, go ahead and click game.exe and the game window will open.

Outlaws is a simple 2D shooter game created in Python. In this game you are a cowboy that can shoot bullets at the opposing robbers to earn points. Try not to get shot, or you will lose!

When you open the game, you are greeted by the menu. Here there are three buttons, Start, Mode, and Quit. Click Start to immediately begin to game on Normal mode. If you would like to test out other modes, click on the Mode button. This will take you to the modes menu, where you can select Easy, Normal, or Hard and click start to begin. If you would like to exit, you can either click the Quit button or the red X on the top right hand corner of the screen.

Once you have entered gameplay, you will see your player character spawned on the bottom half of the screen. You can move around using the arrow keys on your keyboard. To shoot at the enemies, press space. Every robber/enemy that you hit, you earn one point. However, if you get hit, you lose HP. If you get hit 3 times but enemy bullets, you die. Remember, the faster you kill enemies, the less you have to deal with. If you wait around, more will spawn. The win condition is based on the number of enemies you kill in each mode. In easy mode you have to shoot 15 enemies, in normal you have to shoot 20, and in hard you have to shoot 25. 

Once you have died, or killed enough enemies to win, you will be taken to the game over screen. Here you can click back to return to the game menu.
